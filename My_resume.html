            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bio-mitigation of Carbon Dioxide &#45 Study of Bio based processes for carbon dioxide (CO&#x2082) conversion into useful products.
                  Studied various existing living species like algae and bacteria which consume carbon dioxide.
                  In the end, a lab scale design was proposed which was in combination of pre-existing industrial methods for carbon dioxide mitigation and algae & bacteria based CO&#x2082 consumption methods for more effective CO&#x2082 reduction</li>
                <li>Water purification using rice husk &#45 Made a working model for removal of dyes, heavy metals, and other impurities from the water using adsorption properties of rice husk</li>
                <li>Green Flow &#45 A USB powered device which cleans air by adsorbing CO&#x2082 on activated charcoal. We combined a USB fan and activated charcoal tower</li>
                <li>Stress Meter &#45 A device which shows the level of stress qualitatively using the increased conductivity of skin in high stress. We used aluminium (electricity conductor) and LEDs to display the level of stress.</li>
